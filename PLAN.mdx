# Feature Implementation Plan

## Feature 1: Google Maps List Import Tool ✅ COMPLETE

### Objective
Allow users to paste a public Google Maps list URL (e.g., `https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kbtbcuqjmhwmvr5NA`) on the create-map page and automatically import all locations from that list into their map.

### Implementation Summary

**Approach: Server-side scraping with signal-based extraction**

**Key Files:**
- `lib/services/googleMapsListService.ts` - URL resolution, HTML parsing, signal-based extraction
- `lib/supabase/api/bulkImportLocationsAction.ts` - Bulk database insertion with deduplication
- `lib/supabase/api/parseGoogleMapsListAction.ts` - Server action wrapper
- `components/map/GoogleMapsListImport.tsx` - UI component with preview mode

**Architecture:**
1. Find `<script>` tag containing location data (anchored by `/g/` patterns)
2. Extract data array using coordinate pattern anchor `[null,null,LAT,LNG]`
3. Unescape and parse as JavaScript using `Function()`
4. Signal-based recursive walk to extract: name, coords, CID
5. CID used as canonical identifier (no Google Places API needed)
6. Deduplication by CID, URL, and coordinates

**Tested:** 79-location list - extracts all locations correctly

### Checkpoints

#### 1.1 Create URL resolution utility ✅
#### 1.2 Build list scraping/parsing service ✅
#### 1.3 Create Google Places matching utility ⏭️ SKIPPED
- Better approach: Use CID directly from scraping
- CID-based URLs (`https://maps.google.com/?cid={cid}`) are more reliable
- No API calls needed, saves cost/quota

#### 1.4 Create bulk import server action ✅
#### 1.5 Build import UI on create-map page ✅
#### 1.6 Testing and edge cases ✅

## Feature 2: Add Collaborators ✅ COMPLETE

### Objective
Allow map creators to add collaborators via shareable invite links. Collaborators get full edit access (add locations, approve/reject submissions) without needing approval workflow.

### Implementation Summary

**Approach: Invite Links (not email-based)**
- Owner generates a unique invite link per map
- Shares link via WhatsApp, email, etc. (manual sharing)
- Anyone with link can join as collaborator
- No email system needed for invitations

**Key Files:**
- `lib/supabase/collaboratorService.ts` - Client-side service functions
- `lib/supabase/api/collaboratorActions.ts` - Server actions for invite flow
- `lib/supabase/api/permissionHelpers.ts` - Shared permission check helpers
- `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` - Invite acceptance page with all states
- `components/map/CollaboratorsSection.tsx` - UI for managing collaborators
- `lib/utils/auth.ts` - Updated with redirect cookie support

**Database Changes:**
- Added `invite_token` (UUID) column to maps table with auto-generation
- Created `map_collaborators` table with RLS policies
- Added `has_map_edit_permission()` PostgreSQL function

**Tested:**
- Owner visiting own invite link → "This is your map!"
- Logged-out user visiting invite → Sign-in prompt with redirect
- Invalid/expired tokens → Clean error message
- Copy/regenerate invite links → Works correctly
- Old links invalidated after regeneration

### Checkpoints

#### 2.1 Create database schema ✅
#### 2.2 Create invite link service functions ✅
#### 2.3 Create server actions ✅
#### 2.4 Update auth callback for redirects ✅
#### 2.5 Update permission checks ✅
#### 2.6 Build invite acceptance flow ✅
#### 2.7 Build collaborator management UI ✅
#### 2.8 Testing ✅

## Feature 3: Rename "Contribute" to "Suggest Location" ✅ COMPLETE

### Objective
Replace "Contribute" with clearer terminology for better UX.

### Implementation Summary
- Button text changed from "Contribute a Location" to "Suggest Location"
- "Suggest Location" chosen over "Add Location" as it better conveys the submission/approval workflow

### Checkpoints

#### 3.1 Update UI text ✅
- Changed button label in MapDetailsDialog.tsx to "Suggest Location"

#### 3.2 Documentation Updates (Deferred)
- Documentation updates can be done as needed

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Feature 3: Rename "Contribute"** - Quick win, 5 minutes
2. **Feature 1: Google Maps Import** - Medium complexity, needs research first
3. **Feature 2: Collaborators** - Highest complexity, database changes

## Open Questions

### Feature 1 (Google Maps Import)
- [x] ~~Is scraping Google Maps lists feasible/reliable?~~ **Yes, validated**
- [x] ~~Should we consider KML upload as alternative?~~ **No, not user-friendly**
- [ ] Rate limiting for bulk Places API calls - implement delays between calls

### Feature 2 (Collaborators)
- [x] ~~Should collaborators be able to invite other collaborators?~~ **No, only owner can share link**
- [x] ~~Do we need a "viewer" role or just "editor"?~~ **Just editor for now**
- [x] ~~Should there be a limit on number of collaborators?~~ **No limit**
- [x] ~~Can collaborators approve/reject submissions?~~ **Yes, full edit access**
- [x] ~~Link expiry?~~ **No expiry, but owner can regenerate to invalidate**
